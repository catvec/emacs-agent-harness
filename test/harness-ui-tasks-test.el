;;; harness-ui-tasks-test.el --- Tests for the task board  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Drives the task board against the real state layer, the demo
;; provider and the in-process ACP connection: loading, submitting from
;; the compose box, the columns, editing a pending task, the compose box
;; surviving redraws, and the keys on a card.
